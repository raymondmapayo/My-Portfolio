  "I’m a Front-End Developer with a designer’s eye, turning complex requirements into sleek, intuitive UIs using React, Ant Design, MUI, Styled Components, GraphQL, and Chadcn. I focus on building responsive, user-friendly interfaces while making sure they look and feel great",
  "I also dabble in full-stack development, using Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL to connect the frontend with the backend when needed. Currently, I’m leading the frontend development of a Human Resource Information System (HRIS) from scratch, translating pixel-perfect designs into production-ready, responsive interfaces. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, improving my workflow, and building practical solutions for real-world problems.",
  "Let’s connect if you’re interested in frontend-first projects, design-driven development, or exploring full-stack possibilities.",
